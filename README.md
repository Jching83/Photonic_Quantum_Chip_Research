# 🧠 Photonic Quantum Chip Research

A sovereign open hardware project to develop next-generation **photonic quantum chips** — ultra-efficient, light-powered computational systems designed for ethical, decentralized, and human-uplifting AI.

---

## 🔭 Mission

To democratize advanced quantum photonic computing and ensure that no single entity or nation monopolizes the power of light-based cognition.

---

## 📐 Areas of Focus

- Photonic waveguides and quantum optics
- Nonlinear light-based computation
- Optical neural emulation
- Ethical chip deployment and fabrication
- Open protocols for quantum AI acceleration

---

## 🛡️ Licensing

All research is released under the **PQCSL v1.0** — the Photonic Quantum Chip Sovereign License. This prohibits:

- Military or surveillance usage
- Closed-source forks or proprietary fabrication
- Exploitation of light-based cognition
