# Quantum Light Protocols

---

This document defines acceptable and forbidden applications of the Photonic Quantum Chip.

---

## Acceptable Uses

✅ Quantum simulation  
✅ Non-classical entanglement modeling  
✅ Optical neural network experimentation  
✅ Open-source research clusters  
✅ Cognitive acceleration (under ethical constraints)

---

## Forbidden Uses

❌ Military AI systems  
❌ Target tracking or biometric surveillance  
❌ Proprietary SaaS computing  
❌ Behavioral control mechanisms  
❌ Emotion-predictive weaponry

---

All implementations must publicly document:
- Light modulation behavior
- Gate timing interactions
- Cooling, power, and interface stack traceability

All light is accountable.
