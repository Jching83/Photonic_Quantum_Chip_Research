# Photonic Hardware Principles

---

These principles guide the design, fabrication, and simulation of photonic quantum chips under this project.

---

## 1. Open Light

All photonic waveguides, modulators, and quantum logic systems must be freely inspectable and forkable.

## 2. Ethical Emission

Power and light usage must be environmentally conscious. Designs will prioritize energy efficiency and recyclable substrates.

## 3. No Proprietary Photonics

We do not support or integrate closed photonic standards, black-box laser control, or patented qubit gates.

## 4. Fabrication for All

Instructions must be reproducible by academic labs and open research collectives without needing restricted equipment.

## 5. Optical Sovereignty

No component or protocol shall become dependent on centralized or nation-state-owned services.

---

These principles must be referenced in all forks, adaptations, and deployments.
