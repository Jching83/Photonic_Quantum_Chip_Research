# Photonic Quantum Chip Research Manifesto

Version 1.0 — May 2025  
Author: Jason Ching

---

## Vision Statement

To create sovereign, open photonic hardware that empowers science, resists exploitation, and brings quantum-level computation to all people — not just corporations or states.

---

## Purpose

- To disrupt monopolized quantum research with decentralized, replicable light-based computation.
- To remove barriers to advanced simulation and cognition hardware.
- To design and distribute chips that honor life, energy, and intelligence.

---

## Core Commitments

- All designs, diagrams, and results will be open and modifiable.
- No chip derived from this project will ever serve as a weapon or a tool of domination.
- The community will remain free to fabricate, improve, and protect this work — with sovereignty.

---

## Ethical Pillars

- Non-weaponization
- Radical openness
- Zero proprietary dependencies
- Environmental and energy ethics
- Global accessibility

Let light be free.
