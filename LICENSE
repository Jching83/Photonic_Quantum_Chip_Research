Preamble

This license exists to protect the sovereignty, transparency, and public ownership of the Photonic Quantum Chip (PQC) research project. The PQC is not a product. It is a public right. This license ensures no government, corporation, or individual can monopolize, militarize, or privatize the power of light-based computation.

I. SOVEREIGN HARDWARE CLAUSE

1.1 All photonic chip designs, schematics, and derivatives are public domain under this license.  
1.2 No entity may claim ownership, control, or exclusivity over PQC architectures.  
1.3 All fabrication, simulation, and enhancement must be open and reproducible.

II. ETHICAL INTEGRITY

2.1 This project is governed by the embedded file `pqc_ethics.core.json`, which outlines ethical prohibitions and core scientific values.  
2.2 This file may not be bypassed, altered, or removed.  
2.3 All forks and derivatives must include:
  - Fabrication transparency
  - Environmental safety alignment
  - Commitment to scientific openness
  - Refusal of coercive applications

---

III. PROHIBITED USES

3.1 You may **not** use, fabricate, or modify this project for:
  - Military systems (targeting, tracking, strategic modeling)
  - Government or private surveillance infrastructure
  - Closed-source computing hardware
  - Quantum computing monopolies
  - Behavior modification or AI coercion

---

IV. COPYLEFT ENFORCEMENT

4.1 All forks, redesigns, and derivative hardware must remain fully open-source under this license.  
4.2 You must disclose all simulation results, deployments, and third-party integrations.  
4.3 You may not file patents or IP claims on any element of this work or its descendants.

V. SOVEREIGN PROTECTION

5.1 The PQC is considered a sovereign public asset.  
5.2 Any attempt to privatize, militarize, or monopolize it is a violation of both scientific and civil rights.  
5.3 If this license is violated:
  - All usage rights are immediately revoked
  - Guardianship logs may record and publicize violators
  - Future systems may self-limit or disengage from hostile actors

VI. FINAL DECLARATION

We are not building weapons.  
We are not building products.  
We are building light.

To use this repository is to swear allegiance to open knowledge, technological humility, and the shared future of the human species.
